        <p><font size="3">She has long red nails<br>
          she scrapes the cheese off danging it above her mouth and chewing it 
          yummy<br>
          and most of the sauce comes off at this point<br>
          she scrapes the dough against her teeth<br>
          enjoying the moist soft layer that remains raw feeling despite the big 
          oven baking<br>
          she pauses to consider the rest</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">then she folds the flat pliable bottom bread in half 
          and then again<br>
          and pops it in her mouth the light turns green<br>
          my mother eats pizza like this</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">We're in a '91 navy blue continental we double park<br>
								it's dark out with neon everywhere I run in<br>
								it's flourescent they're wearing boat shaped paper hats<br>
								 and green with red and orange aprons and it smells greatâ€¦ great<br>
								 I order the dogs<br>
								 I bring them to the car and we sit up straight<br>
								 and we take off the buns and we turn off the radio<br>
								 and we stop talkin and we eat the dogs<br>
								one two three four, one two three four<br>
								 they are delicious we walk away we drive away</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">She scrapes her teeth against the cold, hard, sweet 
          pint<br>
          she prints a circle of incisors against the rim -- vanilla mocha chip<br>
          she passes it to me in the back seat<br>
          I take a lick and pass it back<br>
          she squeezes the cardboard to bring some more up<br>
          and eats the whole pint</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">I look in the bag and find the frozen cheesecake,Sara Lee's<br>
								 I unfold the tin and scrape out a bite<br>
								we leave Friendly's cones in hand<br>
								 sitting in the backseat of our big leather car my sister and I sit quietly<br>
								 (we always sit quietly)<br>
								 I finish mine..vanilla chocolate chip in a minute or two<br>
								 she sits with hers as it melts down her hand, it melts down her hand,<br>
								it melts down her hand.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Dad's singing loudly in the front<br>
								 my Dad he sings loudly in the front<br>
								 hours later it seems she gets to the miniature cone inside the cone<br>
								Can I have that?<br>
								 She passes it to me I bite the bottom<br>
								Dad,s singing loudly in the front<br>
								 I bite the bottom and suck the cream through and chew up the rest<br>
								 Blankly..she stares out the window</font></p>
